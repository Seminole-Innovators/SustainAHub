"Our Patch" is a web application currently in development as a project for Seminole Innovators. This platform will serve as a central resource for sustainability in Tallahassee, connecting users with local events, organizations, and businesses. An interactive map and calendar will showcase opportunities for community involvement, such as trash clean-ups, invasive plant removals, and other environmental initiatives to better the community.

Coming to the web soon.
